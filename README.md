# MiSTer-Launchbox-Integration-Script
Script for scanning MiSTer over the Network via FTP and creating .bat files to function as "emulators" and "roms" in order to support launching games from an outside application (such as launchbox).  Based on work done by PointNClickPops https://github.com/PointNClickPops/MiSTerBox/wiki/GUIDE:-Launching-MiSTer-files-from-LaunchBox

Usage: run the script and follow the prompts - it will create launcher.bat (the emulator) and game.bat (the rom) It will mirror the same directory structor you have on your MiSTer.  
Use Attract Mode.py to test your files - it will secect a game randomly from the .bat files you've created so far and launch it.
Lastly, import your files into LaunchBox and scan them to get that beautiful METADATA.  Happy Gaming!
